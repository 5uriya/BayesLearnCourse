This is a document with some rough guidelines for the project in the Bayesian
 learning course.
 Note however that the project is very flexible and I don't want to give
 too rigid guidelines for it.

\series bold
Individual
\series default
.
 The project is to be done individually.
 You can of course have the usual discussions with classmates about the
 Bayesian learning in general (I assume this is constantly on your mind!),
 but don't ask for specific solutions to problems that you encounter in
 your project.
 It is YOUR project, YOU get the grade, YOU do the work.

The product
\series default
: You are expected to send me a written report in 
\series bold
PDF
\series default
 format (Word or other word processing software are not acceptable).
 There will be 
\series bold
no oral presentation
\series default
.
 The report should be 
\series bold
clearly written
\series default
 and be concise.
 
\series bold
Explain
\series default
 all the things you do so that I can see that you actually understood what
 you did in the report.
 Pushing a button in some package and dumping a lot of output in the report
 without proper explaination and interpretation is not good enough.
 Make sure that you use the proper Bayesian terminology that we have used
 during the course.
 It is impossible to say anything sensible about the extent (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how many pages?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) of the report.
 All I can say is that the project is 4 credit points and it is the only
 examination for the course.
 Attach computer code in an appendix of the project report.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Software
\series default
.
 You are free to use any available software, but using pre-packaged software
 rather than your own written program code increases the demands on the
 statistical analysis and modelling, and makes it even more important that
 you clearly interpret the results to show that you have understood the
 theory and concepts underlying the analysis performed by the software package.

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
The content
\series default
 of the project.
 You are free to work on any problem you like, but I do expect you to do
 a Bayesian analysis of the problem.
 The typical project involves the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
A well-defined 
\series bold
problem definition
\series default
.
 The problem definition can change when you start analyzing the data, but
 having an idea to start with helps.
 I would suggest that you pick a problem that YOU care about.
 Make it fun for you.
 There is no need to make any kind of novel scientific contribution in this
 course (but I don't mind if you do!).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A 
\series bold
dataset
\series default
.
 It is ok to look at a theoretical problem without any data, but most students
 prefer to analyze some data.
 It is certainly ok to use several data sets, and even to divide the project
 report in more or less unrelated parts.
 But I think that it is easier to do a good project if you focus on a single
 dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Models
\series default
.
 When you choose a problem definition and a dataset, make sure that it gives
 you the oppurtunity to analyze interesting models.
 You can try several models of different parts of the data set (see for
 example in my slides how I first analyzed the Spam data set using a simple
 Bernoulli model with Beta prior, and later on introduced covariates and
 used logistic regression).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Analysis
\series default
.
 Once you have your dataset and some estimated models, move on to analyze
 the results of your analysis.
 Maybe you can illustrate how to do predictions with the model (perhaps
 computing the predictive distribution by simulation)? How to evaluate the
 model fit? Analyze which covariates to include in the model, if you are
 in a regression-type of situation?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Project proposal
\series default
: Submit a project proposal to me no later than 
\series bold
November, 30
\series default
.
 The project proposal is a very short written document (maximum a page or
 so) where you explain what you intended to do in the project.
 Use the four bullet points above (problem definition, dataset, models and
 analysis) to structure your project proposal.
 Keep it brief, just tell me enough so that I can judge if the project is
 worth pursuing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Oral examination
\series default
.
 For master students (which are graded on the A-F scale) I may need to complemen
t the project report with oral examinations for those students for which
 I am uncertain about the grade.
 Oral examinations will be planned bilaterally between me and the selected
 students, but will take place sometimes in the latter part of January.
