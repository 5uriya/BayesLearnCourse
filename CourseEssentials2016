I (Matias Quiroz) talked about these points during the first lecture:

1. Computer labs in pairs (2 credits). Grade: Pass or Fail

2. Individual project (4 credits). Grade: A-F. More is expected from Ph.D. students (on the labs as well).
   It is part of the course to come up with your own project. In general: you should demonstrate that you
   can use what you have learned to solve a problem.
   Deadline: sometime in June (first occassion) and about November (second occassion).

3. Labs and project are submitted through LISAM. "LISAM-room" up and running and the assignments are there soon.

4. Reports should be in pdf-format (no obscure .doc files!). Code must (of course!) be executable.

5. Programming language: use what you wan't, but my illustrations + examples on the home page are in R.

6. Webpage: https://www.ida.liu.se/~732A46/info/courseinfo.en.shtml. I put lectures/labs here as we go along. 
   You can find some R codes written by Mattias Villani.

7. The Git Hub repo: 
   - https://github.com/STIMALiU/BayesLearnCourse. Here you can find an "earlier release", i.e. slides from when 
     Mattias Villani gave the course. I will borrow a lot of Material from his slides.

8. My contact details:
   matias.quiroz@liu.se or quiroz.matias@gmail.com
   Office hours: By appointment, but I am in Link√∂ping only on Tuesdays.
